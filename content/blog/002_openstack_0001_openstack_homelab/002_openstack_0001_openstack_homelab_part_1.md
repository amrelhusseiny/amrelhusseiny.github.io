## Introduction 
In this article I will show you how to setup OpenStack using PackStack on CentOS 8 VM running on ESXI host, this is of course not a production evironment, but its very suitable for running your own tests.

## Lab Setup 
```
Home Machine Specs : 
HyperVisor : ESXI
OS : CentOS 8
RAM : allocated for VM is 67 GB
CPU : 30 cores
Storage : 160GB <<< Much better if you allocate a lot more so you can run your Openstack Labs 
```

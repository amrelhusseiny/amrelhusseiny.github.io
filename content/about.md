# Hi ,

My name is Amro El Husseini,

My career started as a Network engineer, and there is where my passion still reside, I started this blog site in order to document some of the knowledge i needed over my journey, and also to visit some of the theoritical topics that may not show themselves in the day to day work.

I have a lot of intrest in how some things work under the hood, also I am an avid reader, thats why i have listed some of the books that helped me to form my perspective on many technologies at the end of this about page.
